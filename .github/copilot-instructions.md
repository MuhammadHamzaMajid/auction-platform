<!-- Use this file to provide workspace-specific custom instructions to Copilot. For more details, visit https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization#_use-a-githubcopilotinstructionsmd-file -->

This workspace contains two projects:
- `auction-platform-backend` (NestJS, TypeScript): Online auction backend with user roles, real-time auctions, and mock payment logic.
- `auction-platform-frontend` (Angular, TypeScript): Frontend for user registration, login, auction browsing, and real-time bidding.

All code should be documented using JSDoc. Follow best practices for Angular and NestJS. Write unit tests for all custom Angular classes/services/components. Use feature branches and reference project board cards in PRs and commits.
